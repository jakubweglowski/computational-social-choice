# computational-social-choice
Repository with codes used in my bachelor's thesis. Here you can find two things:

# File all_functions.ipynb

This is a file containing all of the functions, basing on which I wrote my thesis. Using those functions I produced all of the results, so after downloading all of the files I used (from fasttext and pabulib) and setting correct paths to them you should be able to reproduce my results.

# Files calles "qqplots"

These are .zip files containing all quantile-quantile plots, some of which I put into my thesis.
